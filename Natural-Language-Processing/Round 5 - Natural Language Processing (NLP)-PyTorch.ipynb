    "NLP is a field of Computer Science dealing with methods to analyze, model, and understand human language. It is composed of tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Speech recognition (or speech-to-text)**: this is what Google uses for converting your voice into text when you are dictating a short message to a friend on your phone or when you do a voice search in the Google app. There are many factors that make this task challenging because different people have different ways of speaking (tone, pronunciation, emphasis) and also, we need to handle improper uses of language (grammatical errors) and background noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part-of-speech tagging**: Have you ever wondered how applications like [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) or [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) can check the grammar in the texts we write? In order to be able to do their job, they use a process (among others) for determining the part-of-speech (PoS) tagging of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. If you want to see a demo, check this website https://huggingface.co/flair/pos-english. The following picture gives you an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PoS Tagging](../Dataset/R5/post-tagging.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Word sense disambiguation**: Words have several meanings, for example, if I say the word '*banco*' to a Spanish-speaking person, her or his first thought would most probably be a bank (financial institution), but I could be talking about a park bench, or maybe I was thinking of a shoal of fish. The point is that the meaning of a word most of the time is subject to the context in which it is used. Word sense disambiguation is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings through a process of semantic analysis. Semantic analysis is the process of drawing meaning from text. It allows computers to understand and interpret sentences, paragraphs, or whole documents, by analyzing their grammatical structure, and identifying relationships between individual words in a particular context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Named entity recognition**: Named entities are sets of elements that are relevant to understanding a text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of finding entities that can be put under categories like names, organizations, locations, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. In the example given in the figure, what do you think is more useful, having *Aalto* and *University* as two separate words or having *Aalto University* as a unit? To be fair, the answer depends on your final goal, but being able to recognize that \"Aalto University\" is an organization, or that \"Alex\" is a proper noun is extremely useful when you are creating relationships between entities.\n",

    "## Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word embeddings** are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meaning and relationships. Unlike traditional one-hot encoding where each word is represented as a sparse vector with only one non-zero element, embeddings map words to dense vectors in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are positioned closer together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties of Word Embeddings:\n",
    "- **Dense representation**: Each word is represented as a vector of real numbers (typically 100-300 dimensions)\n",
    "- **Semantic similarity**: Words with similar meanings have similar vector representations\n",
    "- **Contextual relationships**: Mathematical operations on embeddings can reveal relationships (e.g., king - man + woman ≈ queen)\n",
    "- **Learned from data**: Embeddings are typically learned from large text corpora using algorithms like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-Words vs Embeddings:\n",
    "**Bag-of-Words (BoW)** is a simpler approach where:\n",
    "- Text is represented as a collection of words, disregarding grammar and word order\n",
    "- Each document is represented as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary\n",
    "- Values can be binary (word present/absent) or frequency-based (word count or TF-IDF)\n",
    "- Results in sparse, high-dimensional vectors\n",
    "- Loses semantic information and word relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word embeddings** overcome BoW limitations by:\n",
    "- Capturing semantic meaning and word relationships\n",
    "- Providing dense, lower-dimensional representations\n",
    "- Enabling transfer learning from pre-trained models\n",
    "- Better handling of out-of-vocabulary words (with subword embeddings)"

    "Embeddings are dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words, sentences, or documents. In the context of Natural Language Processing, word embeddings transform discrete tokens (words) into continuous vector spaces where similar words are positioned close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why are Embeddings Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Representation**: Unlike one-hot encoding which treats all words as equally different, embeddings capture semantic similarity. For example, \"cat\" and \"dog\" would have similar embeddings because they're both animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Efficiency**: Instead of having vocabulary-sized sparse vectors (e.g., 50,000 dimensions for a 50k vocabulary), embeddings use dense vectors of much smaller dimensions (typically 100-300).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) allow models to leverage knowledge learned from large text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mathematical Operations**: Embeddings enable meaningful arithmetic operations like: `king - man + woman ≈ queen`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Embeddings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText - each word has a fixed representation\n",
    "- **Contextual Embeddings**: BERT, ELMo, GPT - word representations change based on context\n",
    "- **Subword Embeddings**: Handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into smaller units\n",
    "\n",
    "In our PyTorch CNN model, the embedding layer converts word indices to dense vectors, which are then processed by convolutional layers to extract features for text classification."
