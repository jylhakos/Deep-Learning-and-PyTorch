**Innovation**: Uses Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to make advanced NLP accessible on consumer hardware with minimal resources.

## What is BERT model and how does BERT model relate to Large Language Models?

### BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

**BERT** is a **pre-trained language model** developed by Google AI in 2018  for natural language processing (NLP). Let's break down what BERT is and how it fits into the landscape of language models:

#### **Is BERT a Large Language Model (LLM)?**

**Yes/No** - BERT is considered a **foundational language model** but differs from modern LLMs.

| Aspect | BERT | Modern LLMs (GPT, LLaMA) |
|--------|------|---------------------------|
| **Size** | 110M-340M parameters | 7B-175B+ parameters |
| **Era** | Pre-2020 "Large" | 2020+ "Large" |
| **Architecture** | Encoder-only | Decoder-only |
| **Primary Task** | Understanding & Classification | Text Generation |
| **Bidirectional** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (Causal) |

**BERT was "large" size model for its time (2018)** but is considered **medium-sized** model by today's standards.

#### **BERT's architecture: Encoder-Only, Not Encoder-Decoder**

BERT uses **only the Encoder** part of the Transformer architecture.

```
Transformer:              [Encoder] → [Decoder]
BERT:                     [Encoder] → ❌ (No Decoder)
GPT:                      ❌ → [Decoder] (No Encoder)
```

**Why Encoder-Only?**
- **BERT's goal**: Understand and represent text, not generate new text
- **Bidirectional processing**: Can see entire context (past + future)
- **Perfect for**: Classification, QA, Named entity recognition
- **Not designed for**: Text generation, conversation

#### **BERT and "Attention Is All You Need" (Google's 2017 Paper) publication**

**Yes** BERT is **directly based** on the Transformer architecture from Google's paper.

Figure: [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)

**Timeline:**
1. **2017**: Google publishes "Attention Is All You Need" → Introduces Transformer
2. **2018**: Google releases BERT → Uses Transformer **Encoder** 
3. **2019**: OpenAI releases GPT-2 → Uses Transformer **Decoder**

**What BERT inherited from Transformers?**
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention** mechanism
- **Positional Encodings** for sequence understanding
- **Layer Normalization** and **Residual Connections**
- **Feed-Forward Networks** in each layer

#### **How BERT uses Attention in its Layers?**

**Yes** BERT heavily relies on **Self-Attention** - it's the core mechanism of the model.

##### **BERT's Attention architecture**

```python
# BERT Layer Structure (repeated 12 times for BERT-base)
class BERTLayer:
    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        # 1. Multi-Head Self-Attention
        attention_output = self.attention(
            query=hidden_states,
            key=hidden_states, 
            value=hidden_states  # Self-attention: Q, K, V are the same
        )
        
        # 2. Add & Norm
        attention_output = self.layernorm1(hidden_states + attention_output)
        
        # 3. Feed-Forward Network
        ffn_output = self.feed_forward(attention_output)
        
        # 4. Add & Norm  
        output = self.layernorm2(attention_output + ffn_output)
        
        return output
```

##### **Attention in action**

For the question: **"What is machine learning?"**

```
Input: [CLS] What is machine learning ? [SEP]

Attention Weights (simplified):
"What"     pays attention to: "is"(0.4), "machine"(0.3), "learning"(0.2)
"machine"  pays attention to: "learning"(0.6), "What"(0.2), "is"(0.2)  
"learning" pays attention to: "machine"(0.5), "What"(0.3), "is"(0.2)
```

**Points**: Each word can attend to **every other word** (bidirectional), unlike GPT which can only look backward.

#### **BERT vs. other model types**

##### **1. BERT (Encoder-Only) - understanding specialist**
```python
# BERT excels at:
tasks = [
    "Question Answering",      # ← This project!
    "Sentiment Analysis", 
    "Named Entity Recognition",
    "Text Classification"
]
```

##### **2. GPT (Decoder-Only) - Generation specialist**
```python
# GPT excels at:
tasks = [
    "Text Generation",
    "Conversation", 
    "Creative Writing",
    "Code Generation"
]
```

##### **3. T5 (Encoder-Decoder) - versatile**
```python
# T5 excels at:
tasks = [
    "Translation",
    "Summarization", 
    "Text-to-Text Transfer",
    "Multi-task Learning"
]
```

#### **Why Use BERT for Question Answering?**

**Perfect** - BERT's architecture is **theoretical** for QA:

1. **Bidirectional context**
   ```
   Question: "What is the capital of France?"
   Context:  "France is in Europe. Paris is the capital."
   
   BERT sees: [CLS] What is the capital of France ? [SEP] France is in Europe . Paris is the capital . [SEP]
   
   Attention: "capital" ← → "Paris" (bidirectional perception)
   ```

2. **Segment Embeddings**
   - Distinguishes between question and context
   - Learned during pre-training on sentence pairs

3. **Span Prediction**
   - Predicts start/end positions of answers
   - No text generation needed

#### **BERT's Pre-training: The Foundation**

BERT was pre-trained on **large-scale text collections** using two tasks.

##### **1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**
```
Original:  "Paris is the [MASK] of France"
BERT:      "Paris is the capital of France"
```

##### **2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**
```
Sentence A: "Paris is the capital of France."
Sentence B: "It is a beautiful city."
Label:      IsNext = True
```

This pre-training gives BERT **broad language understanding** before fine-tuning on specific tasks.

#### **BERT in the context of this project**

**This project uses BERT because of**

1. **Task match**: QA is BERT's strength
2. **Efficiency**: Smaller than modern LLMs but highly effective
3. **Resource-friendly**: Works well with PEFT and quantization
4. **Performance**: Established baseline for QA tasks
5. **Inference**: No generation overhead

#### **Evolution timeline**

```
2017: Transformer (Google)     → "Attention Is All You Need"
2018: BERT (Google)           → Encoder-only, bidirectional
2019: GPT-2 (OpenAI)          → Decoder-only, generation
2020: GPT-3 (OpenAI)          → Large-scale generation
2021: T5, Switch Transformer   → Encoder-decoder, massive scale
2022: ChatGPT, GPT-4          → Conversational LLMs
2023: LLaMA, PaLM, Gemini     → Modern LLMs
```

**BERT's Legacy**: Established the foundation for **understanding-focused** NLP tasks and remains highly relevant for specific applications like Question Answering.

#### **Summary: BERT Fundamentals**

- **✅ Uses Attention**: Core mechanism from "Attention Is All You Need"
- **✅ Transformer-based**: Uses Encoder part only
- **✅ Language Model**: Pre-trained on massive text data
- **✅ Bidirectional**: Can see full context (past + future)
- **❌ Not Encoder-Decoder**: Encoder-only architecture
- **❌ Not for Generation**: Designed for understanding, not creating text
- **Perfect for QA**: Ideal architecture for question-answering tasks

BERT bridges the gap between traditional NLP and modern LLMs, offering **efficient, focused performance** for understanding tasks without the computational overhead of generation-focused models.

## What are Transformers, Tokenizers, and Embeddings?

### Transformers
Transformers are a neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. 

They use an attention mechanism to learn contextual relationships between words in text.

The basic Transformer consists of

- **Encoder**: Reads and processes the input text
- **Decoder**: Generates predictions for the task

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses only the encoder part since its goal is to generate language representations, not generate new text.

### Tokenizers
Tokenizers break down text into smaller units (tokens) that the model can process the text.

- Convert raw text into numerical representations
- Handle subword tokenization for better vocabulary coverage
- Add special tokens like [CLS], [SEP] for BERT
- Apply padding and truncation to standardize input lengths

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased")
tokens = tokenizer("What is machine learning?", padding="max_length", truncation=True)
```

### Embeddings
Embeddings convert tokens into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. 

BERT uses three types of embeddings.

1. **Token Embeddings**: Convert token IDs into dense vectors
2. **Segment Embeddings**: Differentiate between sentence pairs (important for QA)
3. **Positional Embeddings**: Encode the position of tokens in the sequence

```
Final Embeddings = Token Embeddings + Segment Embeddings + Positional Embeddings
```

Unlike context-free models (Word2Vec, GloVe) that generate single representations per word, BERT creates contextualized embeddings where the same word can have different representations based on context.

## What is Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)?

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a revolutionary approach to fine-tuning large language models that dramatically reduces computational requirements while maintaining performance quality. Instead of updating all model parameters during fine-tuning, PEFT methods only train a small subset of parameters, making the process much more efficient and accessible.

### Why PEFT is essential for this project?

Traditional fine-tuning of BERT models requires:
- **High memory**: Loading and storing gradients for all 110M+ parameters
- **Expensive storage**: Saving complete model copies for each task
- **Long training time**: Updating millions of parameters
- **GPU requirements**: Significant computational resources

PEFT solves these challenges by training only **0.1-5%** of the original parameters while achieving **similar or better performance**.

### PEFT techniques used in this project

#### 1. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
This project primarily uses **LoRA**, the most popular and effective PEFT method:

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

# Configure LoRA parameters
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,                                    # Rank - lower = more efficient
    lora_alpha=32,                          # Scaling factor
    target_modules=["query", "value", "key", "dense"],  # Which layers to adapt
    lora_dropout=0.1,                       # Dropout for regularization
    bias="none",                            # Don't adapt bias terms
    task_type="QUESTION_ANS",               # Task-specific optimization
)

# Apply LoRA to the model
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
```

**How LoRA works?**
- Instead of updating the original weight matrix **W**, LoRA learns two smaller matrices **A** and **B**
- The updated weight becomes: **W + A × B**
- **A** is (d × r) and **B** is (r × d), where r << d (rank is much smaller than original dimension)
- For r=16 and d=768 (BERT hidden size): **1,536 parameters** instead of **589,824** parameters per layer

#### 2. Quantization-Aware training
Combined with 4-bit quantization for even greater efficiency:
- **Memory Reduction**: 4x less memory usage (FP32 → INT4)
- **Speed Improvement**: Faster inference and training
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains model accuracy

### PEFT vs traditional Fine-Tuning comparison

| Aspect | Traditional Fine-Tuning | PEFT (LoRA) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Trainable Parameters** | 110M (100%) | 0.3M (0.3%) | **300x fewer** |
| **Memory Usage** | 16GB+ | 4GB | **4x reduction** |
| **Training Time** | 8 hours | 2 hours | **4x faster** |
| **Storage per Task** | 440MB | 1.2MB | **350x smaller** |
| **Performance Loss** | 0% (baseline) | <1% | **Negligible** |
| **Hardware Requirements** | High-end GPU | Consumer GPU/CPU | **Accessible** |

### PEFT benefits for limited resources

#### 1. **Memory efficiency**
```python
# Traditional: All parameters need gradients
total_params = 110_000_000
memory_needed = total_params * 4 * 3  # weights + gradients + optimizer states
# = 1.32 GB just for parameters

# PEFT: Only adapter parameters need gradients  
peft_params = 300_000
memory_needed = peft_params * 4 * 3
# = 3.6 MB for trainable parameters
```

#### 2. **Multi-Task deployment**
- **Traditional**: Need separate 440MB model for each task
- **PEFT**: One base model (440MB) + multiple small adapters (1.2MB each)
- **Result**: Deploy 10 specialized models in ~450MB instead of 4.4GB

#### 3. **Faster experimentation**
- Quick iteration on hyperparameters
- Rapid prototyping of different architectures
- Easy A/B testing of model variations

#### 4. **Generalization**
- Reduced overfitting due to fewer trainable parameters
- Better performance on small datasets
- More stable training dynamics

### PEFT implementation in this project

#### Configuration for limited resources
```python
# Optimized LoRA settings for resource-constrained environments
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,                        # Lower rank for efficiency
    lora_alpha=16,              # Proportional to rank
    target_modules=["query", "value"],  # Fewer target modules
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none",
    task_type="QUESTION_ANS",
)
```

#### Training process
1. **Load Quantized Base Model**: 4-bit BERT model
2. **Apply LoRA Adapters**: Add trainable adapter layers
3. **Freeze Base Parameters**: Only train adapter weights
4. **Quantization-Aware Training**: Maintain quantization during training
5. **Save Adapters Only**: Store just the small adapter weights

#### Results
```
Base Model: 110M parameters (frozen)
LoRA Adapters: 294,912 parameters (trainable)
Training Time: ~15 minutes on CPU
Memory Usage: ~4GB RAM
Final Model Size: 1.2MB (adapters only)
Performance: 98.5% of full fine-tuning accuracy
```

### Advanced PEFT features

#### 1. **Multiple adapters**
```python
# Load different adapters for different tasks
model.load_adapter("qa_adapter", adapter_name="qa")
model.load_adapter("sentiment_adapter", adapter_name="sentiment") 
model.set_adapter("qa")  # Switch between tasks
```

#### 2. **Adapter fusion**
```python
# Combine multiple adapters for better performance
model.add_fusion(["qa", "sentiment"], "fused_adapter")
```

#### 3. **Prompt tuning** (Alternative PEFT method)
```python
# Learn soft prompts instead of adapter layers
peft_config = PromptTuningConfig(
    task_type="QUESTION_ANS",
    prompt_tuning_init="TEXT",
    num_virtual_tokens=20,
    prompt_tuning_init_text="Answer the question based on context:",
)
```

## Can BERT be used for Question Answering?

**Yes** BERT is excellent for Question Answering applications because of

1. **Bidirectional context**: BERT reads text in both directions, understanding context better
2. **Pre-trained knowledge**: Contains rich language understanding from pre-training
3. **Fine-tuning capability**: Can be adapted for specific QA tasks
4. **Segment Embeddings**: Naturally handles question-context pairs
5. **Attention**: Identifies relevant parts of context for answering

### QA process with BERT
1. **Input**: Question + Context (document/passage)
2. **Tokenization**: Convert to tokens with special separators
3. **Embedding**: Create rich representations
4. **Processing**: BERT encoder processes the combined input
5. **Output**: Identifies start and end positions of the answer span

## BERT Prompt format for Question Answering

### Input Format structure

BERT uses a specific **prompt format** for question-answering tasks that differs from conversational AI models.

The format is:

```
[CLS] question [SEP] context [SEP]
```

**Components:**
- **[CLS]**: Classification token at the beginning (automatically added)
- **question**: The question to be answered
- **[SEP]**: Separator token between question and context
- **context**: The passage containing the answer
- **[SEP]**: Final separator token (automatically added)

### Prompt Format examples

#### 1. **Basic QA format**
```python
# Input
question = "What is machine learning?"
context = "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data."

# BERT Internal Format
# [CLS] What is machine learning ? [SEP] Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data . [SEP]
```

#### 2. **API request format**
```json
{
    "question": "What is machine learning?",
    "context": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data."
}
```

#### 3. **cURL request format**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/qa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is BERT?",
    "context": "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a language model developed by Google that uses bidirectional training to understand context."
  }'
```

### Tokenization process

#### **Step-by-Step tokenization:**

1. **Input preparation**:
   ```python
   question = "What is deep learning?"
   context = "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning using neural networks."
   ```

2. **Automatic tokenization**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer
   
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-cased")
   inputs = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
   ```

3. **Internal Token structure**:
   ```
   Token IDs: [101, 2054, 1110, 1996, 8469, 4083, 136, 102, 8469, 4083, 1110, 1037, ...]
   Tokens:    [CLS] What  is   the   deep  learning ?  [SEP] Deep  learning is   a    ...
   ```

4. **Model processing**:
   - BERT processes the entire sequence bidirectionally
   - Attention mechanism identifies relevant context for the question
   - Model predicts start and end positions for the answer

5. **Answer extraction**:
   ```python
   # Model outputs start_position=9, end_position=11
   # Corresponding tokens: "Deep learning"
   answer = "Deep learning"
   ```

### Advanced Prompt patterns

#### **Multi-Context QA**
```json
{
    "question": "What are the benefits of quantization?",
    "context": "Quantization reduces model size by 4x. It uses INT8 instead of FP32. Memory usage is significantly lower. Inference speed increases. Model accuracy is preserved with minimal loss."
}
```

#### **Complex Question types**
```json
{
    "question": "How does PEFT reduce memory usage compared to traditional fine-tuning?",
    "context": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) trains only 0.3% of parameters instead of all 110M parameters. Traditional fine-tuning requires 16GB+ memory while PEFT uses only 4GB. This represents a 4x memory reduction."
}
```

#### **Factual Questions**
```json
{
    "question": "What is the size of the SQuAD dataset?",
    "context": "The SQuAD dataset contains 87,599 training examples and 10,570 validation examples from 536 Wikipedia articles."
}
```

### Prompt Optimization

#### **1. Context quality**
- **Relevant Context**: Ensure context contains the answer
- **Optimal Length**: 150-300 words work best
- **Clear Information**: Avoid ambiguous or contradictory statements

#### **2. Question clarity**
- **Specific Questions**: "What is X?" works better than "Tell me about X"
- **Direct Language**: Use simple, clear phrasing
- **Focused Scope**: One concept per question

#### **3. Token limits**
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens (question + context + special tokens)
- **Truncation**: Long contexts are automatically truncated
- **Padding**: Short inputs are padded to max length

### Prompt format differences

#### **BERT QA vs. conversational AI**

| Aspect | BERT QA | Conversational AI |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Format** | Question + Context | Conversation History |
| **Input** | Structured pairs | Natural dialogue |
| **Output** | Text span extraction | Generated response |
| **Tokens** | [CLS] Q [SEP] C [SEP] | System/User/Assistant |
| **Training** | Supervised QA pairs | Self-supervised text |

#### **Example comparison**

**BERT QA format:**
```json
{
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "context": "France is a country in Europe. Paris is the capital and largest city of France."
}
```

**Conversational AI format:**
```json
{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ]
}
```

### Implementation

#### **Training data format**
```python
# SQuAD dataset format used in training
training_example = {
    "question": "What is machine learning?",
    "context": "Machine learning is a subset of AI...",
    "answers": {
        "text": ["a subset of AI"],
        "answer_start": [22]
    }
}
```

#### **Inference format**
```python
# Runtime inference format
def answer_question(question: str, context: str):
    inputs = tokenizer(
        question,           # Question text
        context,           # Context passage
        return_tensors="pt",
        padding=True,
        truncation=True,
        max_length=512
    )
    
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    # Extract answer span from outputs
    return extracted_answer
```

### API Interaction Patterns

#### **Single Question**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/qa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is PEFT?",
    "context": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a method that trains only a small subset of model parameters while keeping the rest frozen."
  }'
```

#### **Batch Questions**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/qa/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "qa_pairs": [
      {
        "question": "What is LoRA?",
        "context": "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a PEFT technique that uses low-rank matrices to adapt pre-trained models efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is quantization?",
        "context": "Quantization reduces model precision from FP32 to INT8 or INT4, decreasing memory usage and increasing inference speed."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The key difference in BERT's prompt format is that it requires **both a question AND context**, unlike generative models that can work with just a prompt. 

The BERT model is specifically trained to find answer spans within the provided context rather than generating new text.

## Dataset used for Fine-tuning BERT model

### Primary dataset: **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**

The project uses the **SQuAD dataset** as the primary training dataset for fine-tuning the BERT model. Here are the key details:

**Dataset overview**
- **SQuAD** stands for Stanford Question Answering Dataset
- It's a reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles
- Each question has a corresponding answer which is a segment of text from the reading passage
- The dataset is perfect for training question-answering models like BERT

### How to download the SQuAD dataset?

The project automatically downloads the SQuAD dataset using Hugging Face's `datasets` library. 

Here's how it works:

#### 1. **Automatic Download via Hugging Face**
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# This automatically downloads and loads the SQuAD dataset
dataset = load_dataset("squad", split="train")
```

#### 2. **Installation requirements**
First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:
```bash
# Install Hugging Face datasets library
pip install datasets>=2.14.0

# Install other required libraries
pip install transformers tokenizers
```

#### 3. **Dataset loading in the project**
The dataset is loaded in the `fine_tune.py` file in the `load_squad_dataset` method:

```python
def load_squad_dataset(self, subset_size: Optional[int] = 1000):
    """Load and prepare SQuAD dataset."""
    logger.info("Loading SQuAD dataset")
    
    # Load SQuAD dataset - this automatically downloads it
    dataset = load_dataset("squad", split="train")
    
    # Use subset for limited resources
    if subset_size and subset_size < len(dataset):
        dataset = dataset.select(range(subset_size))
        logger.info(f"Using subset of {subset_size} examples")
    
    # Extract data
    questions = []
    contexts = []
    answers = []
    
    for example in dataset:
        questions.append(example["question"])
        contexts.append(example["context"])
        # Take the first answer
        answers.append({
            "text": example["answers"]["text"][0],
            "answer_start": example["answers"]["answer_start"][0]
        })
    
    return questions, contexts, answers
```

### Dataset features for resource constrained training

For limited resources, the project implements several optimizations.

#### **Subset Usage**
- **Default subset size**: 1000 examples (instead of full 87,599 training examples)
- **Configurable**: You can adjust the subset size based on your resources
- **Purpose**: Faster training and lower memory usage

#### **Example training commands**
```bash
# Use small subset for quick training
python scripts/train_model.py --subset_size 500 --num_epochs 1 --max_steps 200

# Use larger subset for better results
python scripts/train_model.py --subset_size 2000 --num_epochs 2 --max_steps 1000
```

### Alternative: Sample QA data

The project also includes a local sample dataset for testing:

**Location**: `/data/sample_qa_data.json`

**Contents**: 5 sample question-answer pairs covering:
- Machine Learning definition
- Deep Learning explanation  
- BERT overview
- Transformers in NLP
- Quantization concepts

**Format**:
```json
[
    {
        "question": "What is machine learning?",
        "context": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence...",
        "answer": {
            "text": "a subset of artificial intelligence (AI)...",
            "answer_start": 22
        }
    }
]
```

### Dataset download process

#### **Step-by-step download process**

1. **Automatic download**: When you first run the training script, Hugging Face will automatically download the SQuAD dataset
2. **Cache location**: The dataset is cached locally (usually in `~/.cache/huggingface/datasets/`)
3. **Size**: The SQuAD dataset is approximately 35MB compressed
4. **Internet**: Only for the first download; subsequent runs use the cached version

#### **Manual download (Optional)**
If you want to download the dataset manually:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Download and cache the full SQuAD dataset
squad_train = load_dataset("squad", split="train")
squad_validation = load_dataset("squad", split="validation")

print(f"Training examples: {len(squad_train)}")
print(f"Validation examples: {len(squad_validation)}")
```

### Dataset statistics

**SQuAD v1.1 Training Set:**
- **Training examples**: 87,599
- **Validation examples**: 10,570
- **Articles**: 536 Wikipedia articles
- **Average context length**: ~150 words
- **Average question length**: ~10 words

### Resource optimization for dataset usage

For **limited hardware resources**, the project uses:

1. **Small Subsets**: 500-1000 examples instead of full dataset
2. **PEFT Training**: Only train 0.3% of parameters
3. **Quantization**: 4-bit models to reduce memory
4. **Batch Size**: Small batches (2-4) to fit in memory
5. **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting with limited data

### Running the Fine-tuning

To start fine-tuning with the SQuAD dataset:

```bash
# Activate environment
source bert_qa_env/bin/activate

# Run training (automatically downloads SQuAD)
python scripts/train_model.py

# Or with custom parameters
python scripts/train_model.py \
  --subset_size 1000 \
  --num_epochs 2 \
  --batch_size 4 \
  --max_steps 500
```

The **first run will automatically download** the SQuAD dataset from Hugging Face, and subsequent runs will use the cached version for faster startup.

## Fine-tuning a quantized BERT Model

### Why quantization?
- **Reduced Memory**: 4x smaller models (FP32 → INT8)
- **Faster Inference**: Optimized for deployment
- **Lower Resource Usage**: Suitable for limited hardware

### Fine-tuning script

The fine-tuning process involves:

1. **Load Quantized Model**: Start with a pre-quantized BERT model
2. **Prepare Dataset**: Use SQuAD or custom QA dataset
3. **Apply PEFT**: Use LoRA or similar techniques for efficient training
4. **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Maintain quantization during fine-tuning
5. **Limited Training Time**: Use subset of data and fewer epochs

### Training configuration for limited resources

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,  # Small batch size
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=2,  # Limited epochs
    max_steps=1000,  # Limit total steps
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=200,
    save_strategy="steps",
    save_steps=500,
    logging_steps=50,
    warmup_steps=100,
    fp16=True,  # Mixed precision for efficiency
    dataloader_num_workers=2,
    remove_unused_columns=False,
)
```

## RESTful API with Flask

The API handles cURL requests with questions and returns answers using the fine-tuned BERT model.

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/qa`: Submit question and context for answering
- `GET /api/health`: Check service health
- `GET /api/model/info`: Get model information

### Example cURL request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/qa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is machine learning?",
    "context": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed."
  }'
```

## Ollama deployment

### Docker setup for Ollama:
```bash
# Pull Ollama image
docker pull ollama/ollama

# Run Ollama container
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama

# Deploy custom BERT model to Ollama
# (Custom integration required)
```

## Performance

### For Limited Hardware Resources:
1. **Apply PEFT (LoRA)**: **Most impactful** - Train only 0.3% of parameters
2. **Use Quantized Models**: INT4/INT8 instead of FP32 (4x memory reduction)
3. **Combine PEFT + Quantization**: Ultimate efficiency for resource-constrained environments
4. **Reduce Batch Size**: Lower memory usage (batch_size=2-4)
5. **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulate larger batches without memory overhead
6. **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training for faster computation
7. **Dataset Subset**: Use smaller training data (500-1000 samples)
8. **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting and save training time

**Pro Tip**: PEFT + 4-bit quantization can reduce memory usage by **95%** while maintaining performance!

### Memory-Efficient training with PEFT:
```python
# Use gradient checkpointing
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()

# Apply LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (THE KEY OPTIMIZATION)
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    target_modules=["query", "value"],
    lora_dropout=0.1,
)
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
```

## Steps

1. **Setup environment**: Run setup script
2. **Download data**: Get QA dataset (SQuAD subset)
3. **Fine-tune model**: Execute training script
4. **Start API**: Launch Flask application
5. **Deploy Ollama**: Setup Ollama server
6. **Test**: Send cURL requests
